            <p>In recent years, more and more airlines have been offering their customers 
                the option to “carbon offset” by paying an extra fee at the end of their plane 
                ticket transactions. Supposedly, these funds go towards decarbonization initiatives 
                meant to offset the passenger’s carbon footprint from that plane ride. However, 
                controversy has arisen as to whether these profits are actually going towards 
                their intended purposes.
            </p>
            <p>Here at Green Towards Green, our goal is to ascertain for airline consumers where 
                these funds are going for each airline company that offers them. Using our collection 
                of databases, users can view where exactly their money is going, whether the extra fee 
                is really worth it, and what airlines they may want to reconsider going to in the future. 
                Here, we determine whether the green is really going towards green.
